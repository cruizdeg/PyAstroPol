	abstract = {<p>The Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) polarimetric instrumentation requires very high accuracy calibration of a complex coude path with an off-axis f/2 primary mirror, time dependent optical configurations and substantial field of view to accomplish the critical science observations. Accurate polarization predictions across a diversity of optical configurations, tracking scenarios, slit geometries and vendor coating formulations are critical to the telescope and instrument development efforts for both the design and fabrication process as well as during calibrations and post-processing mitigation efforts. Recent successesin daytime sky polarization calibrations and Zemax system polarization modeling of the 4m AEOS telescope and HiVIS spectropolarimeter show feasibility of making reasonably accurate system performance predictions. AEOS and HiVIS are a DKIST analog with a many-fold coude optical feed creating 100\% polarization cross-talk with altitude, azimuth and wavelength. Predictions of polarimetric performance for the DKIST first-light instrumentation suite have been created under a range of configurations. These new modeling tools and predictions have substantial impact for the design and calibration process in the presence of manufacturing issues, science use-case based performance predictions and ultimate system limitations in the complex DKIST optical train.</p>},

@article{VTT_2005,
abstract = {It is essential to properly calibrate the polarimetric properties of telescopes, if one wants to take advantage of the capabilities of high preci- sion spectro-polarimeters. We have constructed a model for the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) that describes its time-dependent polarization properties. Since the coelostat of the telescope changes the polarization state of the light by introducing cross talk among different polarization states, such amodel is necessary to correct themeasurements, in order to retrieve the true polarization as emitted fromthe Sun. The telescope model is quantified by a time-dependent Mueller matrix that depends on the geometry of the light beam through the telescope, and on material properties: the refractive indices of the coelostat mirrors, and the birefringence of the entrance window to the vacuum tube. These material properties were determined experimentally in-situ by feeding the telescope with known states of polarization (including unpolarized light) and by measuring its response, and from measurements of an aluminum-coated sample in the laboratory. Accuracy can in our case be determined only for the combination of telescope and spectro-polarimeter used; for the instrument POLIS at the VTT, we estimate an accuracy of ±4–5 × 10−3 for the cross talk correction coefficients.},
